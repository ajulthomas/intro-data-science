### Exercise 1






### Excercise 2


```{r}

install.packages("nycflights13")

```
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

```

```{r}

df <- flights

df

l <- filter(df, arr_delay >= 120)

df

# 2 flew to houston

houston_df <- filter(df, dest %in% c('IAH','HOU'))
houston_df <- filter(df, dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')

# 3 were operated by united, american or delta

operator_filter <- filter(df, carrier %in% c('UA','AA','DL'))
operator_filter

flights

# 4 Departed in summer July, August, September

filter(df, month %in% c(7,8,9))

# 5 Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late

filter(df, dep_delay <= 0 & arr_delay >= 120)

# 6 Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
filter(df, dep_delay >= 60, arr_delay - dep_delay > 30)

# 7 Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

filter(df, between(dep_time, 000, 600))

# 8 Their departure time is not recorded (i.e. NA).

filter(df, is.na(dep_time))

```

### Excercise 3

```{r}


# 1  Which month had the highest proportion of the cancelled flights?

cancelled_flights <-  filter(flights, is.na(air_time))
grouped_by_month <- group_by(cancelled_flights, month)
grouped_by_month
counts_per_month <- summarise(grouped_by_month, count=n())
counts_per_month
highest_prop <- summarise(counts_per_month, max_month=month[which.max(count)], max.value=max(count))
highest_prop

# 2  Which month had the lowest proportion of the cancelled flights?

lowest_prop <- summarise(counts_per_month, min_month=month[which.min(count)], min.value=min(count))
lowest_prop

```
